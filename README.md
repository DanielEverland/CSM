# Building
The program can be executed as stated in the documentation for the assignment: https://gitlab.gbar.dtu.dk/02141/mandatory-assignment/blob/master/getting-started-fs.md
We have used a .bat file to easily build and run the project. It requires a path setup to fsi.exe, has only been tested on Windows, and is expected to lie in the root of the project
```
"%~dp0\bin\fslex\fslex.exe" "%~dp0\Task1Lexer.fsl" --unicode
"%~dp0\bin\fsyacc\fsyacc.exe" "%~dp0\Task1Parser.fsp" --module Task1Parser
fsi.exe "%~dp0\Task1.fsx"
PAUSE
```

# Running
The initial signs and programs are manually entered into the source code prior to running the program. The source code comes bundled with three programs and predicates, but adding more can easily be done by following their formatting.

Here's an example from a simple program:
```
map
  [(Start, set [(map [("y", Plus); ("z", Plus)], map [])]);
   (End, set [(map [("y", Plus); ("z", Minus)], map [])]);
   (Inter 1, set [(map [("y", Plus); ("z", Plus)], map [])])]
```

We did not fully implement guarded commands, and as such programs that use guarded commands will not output the same result as fm4fun.

# Modified Files

The files modified for the assignment are:
- Task1.fsx
- Task1Lexer.fsl
- Task1Parser.fsp
- Task1TypesAST.fs

The following files were auto-generated by building the project as previously mentioned:
- Task1Lexer.fs
- Task1Parser.fs
- Task1Parser.fsi
