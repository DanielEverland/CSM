# Building
The program can be executed as stated in the documentation for the assignment: https://gitlab.gbar.dtu.dk/02141/mandatory-assignment/blob/master/getting-started-fs.md
We have used a .bat file to easily build and run the project. It requires a path setup to fsi.exe, has only been tested on Windows, and is expected to lie in the root of the project
```
"%~dp0\bin\fslex\fslex.exe" "%~dp0\Task1Lexer.fsl" --unicode
"%~dp0\bin\fsyacc\fsyacc.exe" "%~dp0\Task1Parser.fsp" --module Task1Parser
fsi.exe "%~dp0\Task1.fsx"
PAUSE
```

# Running
The input expects a valid GCL program and will output the final state of the program when it either successfully finished or had to terminate prematurely.
When the program has been entered it will ask the user to input the starting values for the variables the program uses one at a time.
```
Enter an input program: if x>=y -> z:=x [] y>x -> z:=y fi
Please enter one variable at a time. Finish by typing "quit"
x=5
Please enter one variable at a time. Finish by typing "quit"
y=10
Please enter one variable at a time. Finish by typing "quit"
quit
status: terminated
Node: qE
x: 5
y: 10
z: 10
```

## Stuck Programs
If the program detects that it cannot continue execution with the given input, it will terminate and output the node it was stuck at and the current memory
```
Enter an input program: if x>=y -> z:=x fi
Please enter one variable at a time. Finish by typing "quit"
x=0
Please enter one variable at a time. Finish by typing "quit"
y=1
Please enter one variable at a time. Finish by typing "quit"
quit
status: stuck
Node: qS
x: 0
y: 1
```
## Arrays
The intepreter also supports arrays as shown in this example with an insertion sort program
```
Enter an input program: i:=1; do i<n -> j:=i; do (j>0)&&(A[j-1]>A[j]) -> t:=A[j]; A[j]:=A[j-1]; A[j-1]:=t; j:=j-1 od; i:=i+1 od
Please enter one variable at a time. Finish by typing "quit"
n=4
Please enter one variable at a time. Finish by typing "quit"
A=[4,3,2,1]
Please enter one variable at a time. Finish by typing "quit"
quit
status: terminated
Node: qE
i: 4
j: 0
n: 4
t: 1
A: { 1, 2, 3, 4 }
```

# Modified Files
