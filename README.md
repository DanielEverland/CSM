# Building
The program can be executed as stated in the documentation for the assignment: https://gitlab.gbar.dtu.dk/02141/mandatory-assignment/blob/master/getting-started-fs.md
We have used a .bat file to easily build and run the project. It requires a path setup to fsi.exe, has only been tested on Windows, and is expected to lie in the root of the project
```
"%~dp0\bin\fslex\fslex.exe" "%~dp0\Task1Lexer.fsl" --unicode
"%~dp0\bin\fsyacc\fsyacc.exe" "%~dp0\Task1Parser.fsp" --module Task1Parser
fsi.exe "%~dp0\Task1.fsx"
PAUSE
```

# Running
The predicates and programs are manually entered into the source code prior to running the program. The source code comes bundled with two programs and predicates, but adding more can easily be done by following their formatting.

Once the program is executed logical formulas will be output for each edge in the SPF.

Here's an output based on the loop example from the lectures:
```
M=m => M=(0)*n+m
M=q*n+m => M=(q+1)*n+(m-n)
M=q*n+m => M=q*n+m
```

# Modified Files

The files modified for the assignment are:
- Task1.fsx
- Task1Lexer.fsl
- Task1Parser.fsp
- Task1TypesAST.fs

The following files were auto-generated by building the project as previously mentioned:
- Task1Lexer.fs
- Task1Parser.fs
- Task1Parser.fsi
