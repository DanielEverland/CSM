# Building
The program can be executed as stated in the documentation for the assignment: https://gitlab.gbar.dtu.dk/02141/mandatory-assignment/blob/master/getting-started-fs.md
We have used a .bat file to easily build and run the project. It requires a path setup to fsi.exe, has only been tested on Windows, and is expected to lie in the root of the project
```
"%~dp0\bin\fslex\fslex.exe" "%~dp0\Task1Lexer.fsl" --unicode
"%~dp0\bin\fsyacc\fsyacc.exe" "%~dp0\Task1Parser.fsp" --module Task1Parser
fsi.exe "%~dp0\Task1.fsx"
PAUSE
```

# Running
Programs, security lattices and security classifications are defined in the source code. Two programs each with a secure and unsecure classification are provided as examples.

When the program is run it will simply output a boolean value defining whether the program is secure or not. True means the program is secure, while False means the program is not secure. We have compared with results on fm4fun to verify that the program works.

# Modified Files

The files modified for the assignment are:
- Task1.fsx
- Task1Lexer.fsl
- Task1Parser.fsp
- Task1TypesAST.fs

The following files were auto-generated by building the project as previously mentioned:
- Task1Lexer.fs
- Task1Parser.fs
- Task1Parser.fsi
